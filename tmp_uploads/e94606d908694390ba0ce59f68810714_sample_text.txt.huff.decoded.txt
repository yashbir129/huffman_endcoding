The Huffman coding algorithm is a lossless data compression algorithm. It was developed by David A. Huffman while he was a Ph.D. student at MIT in 1952.

The algorithm works by assigning variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters. This approach produces a prefix code, meaning no code is a prefix of another, which simplifies decoding.

Huffman coding is optimal when the exact probability distribution of symbols in the input is known and when each symbol is encoded independently. It's widely used in various compression formats like JPEG, PNG, MP3, and ZIP.

The basic steps of Huffman coding are:
1. Calculate the frequency of each character in the input
2. Build a Huffman tree based on these frequencies
3. Traverse the tree to assign codes to characters
4. Encode the input using these codes

When you decompress, you simply follow the encoded bits through the Huffman tree until you reach a leaf node, which represents the original character.

This sample text file should provide a good test for your Huffman compression algorithm, as it contains a mix of characters with varying frequencies.
